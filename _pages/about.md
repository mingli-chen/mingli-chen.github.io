**Bio**

I am an Associate Professor of Economics in the Department of Economics at the University of Warwick, a Research Associate at CeMMAP, and a Turing Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute (the UK's National Institute for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). She is working on econometrics, with a special focus on panel data models, social networks, quantile regression, and AI + machine learning both in theoretical inference and applications in economics.


My research fields are Econometrics, Time Series Econometrics, Financial Econometrics and Industrial Organization. In particular, my research papers focus on big data (observations and/or variables are large), detection of structural breaks, large network estimation, and the study of consumer payment choice.
